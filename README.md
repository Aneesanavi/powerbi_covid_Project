# powerbi_covid_Project


The project encompasses several key elements:

Data Preprocessing: Clean, Integrate, and Transform the COVID-19 data. This ensures data accuracy and consistency.

Measures for Deeper Insights: These are custom calculations created using Data Analysis Expressions (DAX) to provide dynamic insights. Measures help to  calculate complex statistics, track key performance indicators, and offer contextual analytics, enhancing the depth of our analysis.

Overview Cards: These cards provide a snapshot of essential COVID-19 statistics, including confirmed cases, recoveries, active cases, recovery rate, and total deaths.

Time Trends: Visualize the ebb and flow of the pandemic with a dynamic line chart tracking total confirmed and active cases by month.

Regional Comparisons: Compare data across countries and regions using a bar chart that highlights total deaths, recoveries, and confirmed cases.

Filtering Slicers: Empower users to drill down into specific data by country or date range, offering greater interactivity and precision in analysis.

Global Impact Map: Gain a global perspective with an interactive map, where bubbles of varying sizes represent active cases by region, and tooltips reveal death and recovery stats on hover.

Daily Updates Table: Stay up-to-date with a detailed table providing daily changes in cases, deaths, and recoveries, helping to monitor current trends.

Insightful Donut Charts: Discover the top five countries with high case fatality rates and high recovery rates through visually engaging donut charts.

In summary, the Power BI project offers an all-encompassing view of COVID-19 data, enhanced by the use of measures for deeper insights, allowing users to explore, analyze, and draw meaningful insights from the ever-evolving pandemic landscape."
